- Addition of loading service to abstract out spinner rendering ([PR #1172](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/1172))
- Better error handling and display ([PR #104](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/pull/104))
- UI Improvements and bug fixes ([PR #114](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/pull/114), [PR #118](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/pull/118), [PR #122](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/pull/122), [PR #1134](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/1134))
