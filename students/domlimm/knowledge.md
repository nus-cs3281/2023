### Angular

#### Context

Before TEAMMATES, I have only ever used React. To help me get started on Angular, I looked up videos on YouTube, specifically [Fireship's Angular playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vfts4VzfNjsTV_6i9a9iczMnthWqHzM), to get an overview. I tried doing a Udemy course too but I thought it was a little far-fetched.

With a background in React, I went onto look for the similarities and differences between these two popular frontend web frameworks which led me to decide to dive into TEAMMATES' codebase.

#### Passing data between Parent and Child components

Similar to passing of props in React, Angular has its way to pass data between parent and child components.

In Angular, we use `Output` for sending data to parent and `Input` for sending data to child. It took me awhile to get used to the terms of `in/output`.

What helped me through this was the [Angular docs](https://angular.io/guide/inputs-outputs) on this exact matter, it was a perfect read! It starts off with the introduction of Input and Output, and was surprised it's said to be like a pattern. This page was really well written as it goes straight to the subject and it takes a step by step approach with sufficient amount of examples.
