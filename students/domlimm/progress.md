# CS3281 Semester's Progress

## Summary

I was assigned to work on the v9-migration from noSQL to SQL of TEAMMATES.

The tasks that I have done range from

- Creating entities.
- Writing up the DB functionalities of the respective entities.
- Adding the business/logic layers of the respective entities.
- Migrating the endpoints i.e., Actions.

Aside from the above, I have worked on a few other frontend related tasks, reviewed PRs and manage issues of new contributors.
