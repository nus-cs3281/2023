### Angular (Frontend framework)

I learnt Angular from scratch to build the dashboard for the onboarding task. 
Having previous experience with React, it is interesting to see the differences between frameworks and use the frameworks to implement functionality such as sorting, search etc. 

Compared to React, Angular has more built in functionality such as debouncing function already in-built into the EventEmitter whereas in React we would have to use 3rd party libraries such as Lodash.
