### Tool/Angular Framework Overview

Without any prior knowledge to Angular, I have quickly gone through the introduction part of [TypeScript tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) and a hands-on practice with Angular by [official Angular website](https://angular.io/start) to quickly familiarise myself with the framework.

The [TypeScript tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) provides very in-depth explanation of the language as well as listing out the notable difference between TypeScript and other common programming languages. It includes great number of details but can be overwhelming to beginners. I briefly looked through the program and wrote some common algorithms in TypeScript to make sure I roughly knew the basic component before proceeding to read about Angular. This resource is better served as a handbook to check when one encounters complex problems related to TypeScript specifically.

The [Official Angular Start Guide](https://angular.io/start) provides a walk-through of building a shopping website with Angular which involves component, service, data management and transfer -- essentially everything needed for a basic website. It is a fun experience and the guide is very clear and helpful.
