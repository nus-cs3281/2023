## Summary

During my journey in CS3281, I have mainly contributed to the update for both CATcher-docs and [WATcher-docs](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher-docs), Angular upgrade for WATcher, adding a [test repository for WATcher](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher-test) (for easy UI test) while submitting and fixing various UIX-related bugs along the way.
