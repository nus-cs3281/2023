To trust data-in-motion, applications need end-to-end guarantees of data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. To be private and secure by-design, applications must have granular control over every trust and access decision. Ockam allows the app developer to add these controls and guarantees to any application.</p> <p>As of March 2023, Ockam has a total of 3K stars of Github, 203 OSS contributors (including me) and 272K downloads on Crate (Rust's Package Registry).</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam">Project website</a></p> <h3 id="external-project-workflow"><span id="external-project-workflow" class="anchor"></span>External Project Workflow<a href="#external-project-workflow" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>The workflow for contributing to Ockam is pretty standard as far as open-source projects goes. A few things that I noticed that were really great were that the project maintainers were very helpful and the PRs were being reviewed quickly (often in less than 1 week's time).</p> <ol><li>Find an issue to work on, ideally issues that are tagged <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good-first-issues</code>.</li> <li>Work on fixing the bug
<ul><li>If there are any setup issues, the Ockam team has set up a <a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/discussions/1642">discussion forum</a> to help troubleshoot any issues.</li></ul></li> <li>Accept the <a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors/blob/main/CLA.md">Ockam Contributor License Agreement</a></li> <li>Craft proper commit messages.
<ul><li>Each commit should have a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">type</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang">scope</code>. It should be organized as <code class="hljs inline no-lang">type(scope): &lt;subject&gt;</code>.

Basically the idea of secure channel listeners that they are secure components that are able to consume any event that passes through a secure channel. This allows users to create channel listeners that are more secure since all of the traffic will be end-to-end encrypted.</p> <p>This involved creating new structs in Rust for user commands to the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">secure-channel-listener</code> command, interacting with the backend to modify secure channel listeners and doing proper error handling when the user supplies erroneous inputs. More details in the PR.</p> <p>Original issue: <a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/issues/3192">Implement ockam secure-channel-listener list command #3192</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/4120">refactor(rust): set default_node_name using clap #4120</a></p> <p>My third contribution is a refactor code change that improves the code quality of Ockam's codebase by abstracting away the use of Optionals and replacing it with a utility function that handles the interaction with optional objects. Hence, a new developer would not have to be familiar with the proper way of handling optionals and could focus more on actual API development.</p> <p>Original issue: <a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/issues/4080">ockam node start command: set default value to node argument using Clap attributes #4080</a></p></li></ul> <p>In addition to all the merged PRs, I'm pleased to say that I have been recognized by the team at Ockam for my contributions during one of their <a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/discussions/3381">release</a> ðŸŽ‰!</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record"><span id="my-learning-record" class="anchor"></span>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <h4 id="how-to-improve-visibility-of-the-project"><span id="how-to-improve-visibility-of-the-project" class="anchor"></span>How to improve visibility of the project<a href="#how-to-improve-visibility-of-the-project" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>While Ockam as a project only started in 2021, it has now garnered over 3k stars on Github and hundreds of contributors have previously contributed to it. I think one of the main things that I saw the team at Ockam doing to improve the visibility of the project is to maintain a healthy supply of <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good-first-issues</code> issues.</p> <p>This is because many sites such as <a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/">https://goodfirstissue.dev/</a> and <a href="https://goodfirstissues.com/">https://goodfirstissues.com/</a> essentially scrapes Github repos for <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good-first-issues</code> tag and highlights those projects with a higher number of <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good-first-issues</code>.</p> <h4 id="rust"><span id="rust" class="anchor"></span>Rust<a href="#rust" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Ockam's codebase is mainly written in Rust as it is more secure over other systems languages such as C++, while still retaining much of the performance benefits of being a low-level systems language which is important in the context of cryptographic operations.</p> <p>The main resource that I used for learning Rust is the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">official Rust website</a>. There's a more comprehensive <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">textbook</a> that I occasionally referred to when investigating certain semantics of the language. In particular, as someone who is very into Programming Languages and Compilers, I really appreciated Rust's approach to safe memory management through what they call the Ownership System. This is beautifully explained in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">Chapter 4 of the textbook</a>.</p> <h4 id="cargo"><span id="cargo" class="anchor"></span>Cargo<a href="#cargo" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Most Rust projects use this tool because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for them, such as building code, downloading the libraries their code depends on, and building those libraries. Ockam also uses Cargo.</p> <p>I really appreciated the fact that Cargo is shipped together with Rust as a bundle, since other similar languages such as C++ do not and it led to a lot of pain in finding the right build tool and package manager. The main resource that I used can be found in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html">Rust textbook</a>.</p> <h4 id="end-to-end-encryption"><span id="end-to-end-encryption" class="anchor"></span>End-to-end Encryption<a href="#end-to-end-encryption" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>This topic is relevant to my project since one of the main uses of Ockam is to allow app developers to easily introduce end-to-end encryption to their project.</p> <p>End-to-end encryption is a security method that basically ensures that only the sender and the receiver of a message are able to read the message. This means that any third-party intermediaries that the message passes through will not be able to read that message. In particular, it will mean that the government / relevant authorities will not be able to read that message.</p> <p>End-to-end encryption has become a really hot topic in security recently due to the greater awareness and focus on the topic of user privacy.</p> <p>Some relevant resources on end-to-end encryption:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">End-to-end encryption wiki</a></li> <li><a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543">Whatsapp's end-to-end encryption</a></li> <li><a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/10262381?hl=en">Google's end-to-end encryption</a></li></ul> <h3 id="recommendations-for-markbind-project"><span id="recommendations-for-markbind-project" class="anchor"></span>Recommendations for Markbind Project<a href="#recommendations-for-markbind-project" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <ol><li>Ensure that there is a healthy supply of <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good-first-issue</code> issues</li></ol> <p>Seeing how Ockam was able to greatly improve its visibility by having a lot of <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good-first-issue</code> issues, it would be good to have a healthy supply of <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good-first-issue</code> issues for Markbind too. This would involve Markbind developers to leave certain low-hanging fruits for new contributors to tackle.</p> <ol start="2"><li>Use Github Actions liberally to enforce checks</li></ol> <p>Ockam uses a total of 17 Github Actions workflows to check various things when a PR is submitted such as style checks, commit message style check, ensuring that new tests were added and the tests passes, etc. I think there is still room to improve for Markbind in terms of using Github Actions to make certain checks. In particular, I think it would be helpful to have a workflow to check that commit messages follow the proper convention, since that is a pretty common issue that keeps coming up when reviewing PRs.</p> <ol start="3"><li>Tagging commits with the issue type</li></ol> <p>Ockam enforces a convention for commits where the commit has to be tagged with a relevant issue type such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang">feat</code> for feature, <code class="hljs inline no-lang">fix</code> for bug fix, <code class="hljs inline no-lang">refactor</code> for refactor and so on. I think this is a good way of organizing commits since one would know at a glance, what's the purpose of that commit. In addition, it would be easier when making a release since the commits are already properly tagged.</p> <i id="scroll-top-button" onclick="handleScrollTop()" aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-arrow-circle-up fa-lg d-print-none"></i></div> <nav id="page-nav" class="fixed-header-padding" data-v-e8c82f88><div class="nav-component slim-scroll" data-v-e8c82f88></div> <!----></nav></div> <footer><div class="text-center"><p>[<strong>This site was generated using <img src="https://markbind.org/favicon.ico" width="25"> <a href="https://markbind.org/">MarkBind 4.1.0</a></strong> on Tue, May 2, 2023, 2:23:27 PM UTC]<br> <span class="dimmed"><small><small>favicon.ico of this site was made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons" title="Smashicons">Smashicons</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a></small></small></span></p></div></footer></div>
