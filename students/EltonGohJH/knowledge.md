### Special mention to ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot
A fun fact is that I use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for everything in the list below.
ChatGPT just makes it so much easy to write and debug code. ChatGPT has really helped me to picked up the technology and tools mentioned below.
I find that GitHub Copilot is super helpful when writing boiler plates code and code in general.

### Vue.js
During the semester, I learned the fundamentals of Vue.js, including the Vue lifecycle, creating Vue components, and working with both Vue 2 and Vue 3. 
It was exciting to discover that my previous experience with React was easily transferable to Vue, which helped me to quickly grasp the fundamentals of the framework.

While using Vue, I also realised the importance of having a huge community behind a framework. 
When working with Vue, I find it harder to find solutions online as there are less resources available compared to React.
However, I still had a great time learning Vue and learning a new framework for Frontend.

#### Resource used:
- [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/): This is the most valuable resource I used to learn Vue. The docs are pretty well written and easy to understand. 
However, there are some parts that are not very well documented such as SSR.

### Monorepo and Monorepo management tools
During the semester, I learned about Monorepo and Monorepo management tools like Lerna, NPM Workspaces, and Turborepo. 
I gained an understanding of the benefits that Monorepo provides, such as simplified version control, dependency management and sharing of configs.
I learned how Monorepo management tools can help with versioning and also help to speed up running test and building through concurrency and caching.

Overall, I gained a greater appreciation for Monorepo and its management tools, and I can see how they can greatly simplify software development and improve efficiency.

#### Resource used:
- [Lerna docs](https://lerna.js.org/): This is the main resource I used to learn about Lerna. The docs are pretty well written and easy to understand.
- [Fireship on monorepo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iU_IE6vnJ8): This is a good summary video by Fireship which shares about what exactly is Monorepo and why it is useful.

### Serverside Rendering (SSR)
This is my first time actually working with SSR directly.
Prior to this, I only have a basic understanding of SSR, and I was not sure how it works.
Through learning how to migrate from Vue 2 and Vue 3, I have really learnt a lot about how SSR works and why is it needed.
Below are a list of things that I have learned about SSR:
- How does SSR work and what are the benefits of using SSR?
- How does SSR differ from Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?
- What is client-side hydration and how does it work in conjunction with SSR?
- 
I am really glad that I have learnt about SSR as SSR will is getting more and more prevalent in the industry.

#### Resource used:
- [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/): This is super helpful in understand about SSR in vue.
- Other than that, I think a lot of SSR and even CSR knowledge is learned from ChatGPT.

### Webpack
Previously, in all honesty I did not really know what Webpack is and how it works.
Webpack seems to just be a magical tool that just works.
Through updating of Webpack and attempting to migrate Vue 2 to Vue 3. I learned a lot about Webpack and what it does.
Below are a list of things that I have learned about Webpack:
- What is Webpack and how does it work? (bundling etc.)
- Learned about different types of Webpack plugins

#### Resource used:
- [Webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/): This is the main resource I used to learn about Webpack.

### I learn how to use Open Source Software
This is quite a random learning point, but I think it is important to mention.
Somehow, I handled a lot of upgrading of dependencies.
I learned how to safely update dependencies and ensure that it does not break a codebase.
I also learned the importance of reading the changelog and release notes of dependencies.

I had a painful experience when I had to debug why html format has changed after running npm install.
The reason for this is that the developer of js-beautify has changed the way it formats custom tag but did not mention it in the release notes.
This caused a lot of tests to fail and I had to spend a lot of time debugging it. 

Through this experience, I learned the importance of ensuring that changes are documented properly and correctly.
