### Vue.js

One of the largest takeaways from working with MarkBind in the last semester has been Vue.js, an open-source front-end framework that MarkBind uses to build it's UI components. Previously, only knowing the React.js framework, Vue.js is a handy addition to my arsenal. The basics of Vue.js was rather simple to pick up. Reading the [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html), and referencing examples of already implemented Vue components in MarkBind, I quickly understood the use of `<template>`, `<style>` and `<script>`. Through [Markbind's Developer Guide](https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/development/writingComponents.html), I learnt how to easily create different kinds of Vue components and implement them in MarkBind.

As I implemented my first Vue component, [Add autogenerated breadcrumbs component #2193](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2193), I delved deeper into Vue, exploring the use of `data()`, to manage the internal state of Vue components, and `methods()` to define methods to be used within the component. I also learnt more about Vue lifecycle hooks, in which I used the `mounted` hook to allow the Breadcrumb component to query the SiteNav to figure out the hierarchy of the current page.

As I continued working on improving MarkBind's frontend, I learnt more about Vue's `<transition>` component, in particular using transition hooks. While I was working on [Fix Quiz expanding between questions #2184](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2184), I came realize how useful these hooks were, helping to create seamless transitions for different situations. I relied heavily on [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html#javascript-hooks) and [StackOverflow Posts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59632929/vue-js-animation-enter-after-leave-and-not-simultaneously) as I was researching about Vue's transition hooks.

### Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation

When I was working on implementing the new Breadcrumb and Collapse/Expand All Buttons components, I had to extensively use `Document.querySelector()` and other related methods. I was new to this and had to do some research about how the methods work, what happens if the object cannot be found and handling edge cases. By practicing these while implementing the two components mentioned above, I believe that I have become more proficient in doing this. As a side-effect of this, I have also gained a deeper understanding on how the DOM works.

### Jest/Vue Test Utils

Jest and Vue Test Utils were something that I was new to coming into MarkBind. MarkBind uses Jest together with Vue Test Utils for its snapshot tests, which test Vue components against their expected snapshots. As I was updating and implementing Vue components, I had to update and create the relevant test suites to ensure that the Vue components that I was updating or creating were working as expected. I explored mounting the components, attaching components to a document to allow another component to interact with them.

### Typescript

As MarkBind is undergoing a migration to Typescript, I put in some time to learn basic Typescript. This was important as mid-way through the semester, as many of the files were being migrated to Typescript. This has also helped me in reviewing PRs that deals with Typescript migration and PRs which affect the Typscript files in MarkBind.

### UI

When updating the looks of old components and creating new ones, I had to do some research about what makes a website visually pleasing. My most interesting finds were about the use of [golden ratios](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/golden-ratio-designers/) in design and choosing complementary colours with tools such as [Canva's Colour Wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/). I also learnt the different meanings of different icons through exploration and discussions with [Update Breadcrumb icons #2265](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2265) and [Add CollapseExpandButtons component](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2206).

I also internalized how to create transitions and effects that fit with the theme of the project, for MarkBind, had a more minimal theme. This was done when updating designs of components in [Tweak sitenav design #2204](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2204), [Update Question/Quiz component design #2131](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2131).

### Project Management

As I progressed to start managing the project, I started reviewing and merging PRs. Initially as I reviewed smaller PRs, I had little problem understanding the code and understanding where it can be improved. However, as I reviewed more complex PRs, I began having difficulties understanding the changes quickly. I came across a method to understand code in a more simple manner, the [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) method. Using this helped me to try and understand the code line by line and handle more complex changes more managably, helping me to understanding them better.
