### Summary
I worked on frontend features for RepoSense. Some notable features include:
* Showing merge commits and deletes commits in the report
* Showing author breakdown in commits panel on merge group using highlights 
* Pinning the file title for better user experience

Apart from that, I assisted with the frontend migration to TypeScript, made our Cypress tests more robust and did minor tasks for the backend involving Git, Java as well as package upgrades for frontend DevOps.
