href="#tool-angular-framework-overview" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>Without any prior knowledge to Angular, I have quickly gone through the introduction part of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html" data-v-b8113688>TypeScript tutorial</a> and a hands-on practice with Angular by <a href="https://angular.io/start" data-v-b8113688>official Angular website</a> to quickly familiarise myself with the framework.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Angular adopts the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, similar to MVC (Model-View-Controller) but with some differences: in MVVM, the ViewModel replaces the role of Controller in MVC and acts as a mediator between the Model and the View. The ViewModel provides data and functionality to the View and the View communicates user actions back to the ViewModel.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Angular also makes use of Components, Services, Directives and RxJS to build an Angular application:</p> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688>Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. Components are responsible for defining the view, handling user input, and interacting with the model.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Services are used to share data and functionality across components. They provide a way to centralize common functionality and make it available to the entire application.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Directives are used to add behavior to the DOM elements and allow us to manipulate the DOM and add custom functionality to applications.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>RxJS is a creative programming library to provide a way to work with asynchronous data streams and handle events in a declarative way.</li></ul> <p data-v-b8113688>Angular recommends the usage of TypeScript for its forceful type checks to variables as compared to original JavaScript.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>The <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html" data-v-b8113688>TypeScript tutorial</a> provides very in-depth explanation of the language as well as listing out the notable difference between TypeScript and other common programming languages. It includes great number of details but can be overwhelming to beginners. I briefly looked through the program and wrote some common algorithms in TypeScript to make sure I roughly knew the basic component before proceeding to read about Angular. This resource is better served as a handbook to check when one encounters complex problems related to TypeScript specifically.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>The <a href="https://angular.io/start" data-v-b8113688>Official Angular Start Guide</a> provides a walk-through of building a shopping website with Angular which involves component, service, data management and transfer -- essentially everything needed for a basic website. It is a fun experience and the guide is very clear and helpful.</p> <h3 id="angular-upgrade" data-v-b8113688><span id="angular-upgrade" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Angular Upgrade<a href="#angular-upgrade" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>In WATcher, I drafted PRs to upgrade Angular version from 8 to 10. While following the instructions by the <a href="https://update.angular.io/" data-v-b8113688>official guide</a>, I worked with various problems along the way: outdated versions of certain dependency, linting errors, wrong modifier and manual upgrade of certain new imports after merge, and managed to solve them accordingly.</p> <h3 id="tool-github-actions-markbind" data-v-b8113688><span id="tool-github-actions-markbind" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Tool/GitHub Actions + Markbind<a href="#tool-github-actions-markbind" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>During rendering the <a href="https://catcher-org.github.io/WATcher-docs/" data-v-b8113688>WATcher-docs website</a>, I read about Github Actions and they would be triggered upon pull requests or change to specified branches.

However, to refresh my memory as well as to familiarise myself with the Angular environment. I frequently referred to Angular documentation online for help.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Both Angular and another popular framework React uses a component-based architecture where developers will develop reusable components, classes as well as directives to assist in building the application. By modularising different aspect of the application into different modules, Angular enables developers to allow each componenet to have its own specialisation as well as to allow easy unit testing on each individual components.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>While Angular seems to be very convoluted and heavy compared to React, a lot of its potential and ease of use is actually automated via the Angular CLI, which allows developers create template files for each component they are building.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>The benefit of Typescripts is noticeable in the long run. While Javascript has dynamic typings as well as inferred types, in the long run, it is extremely difficult for developers to maintain and manage without proper documentation due to the lack of typings. Typescript essentially fixes this issue by forcefully introducing types to variables as well as enabling better linting compared to the base Javascript. Typescript adds on an additional layer of compilation where Typescript code will be compiled efficiently into Javascript code before it is launched and run. While this seems like a waste of effort, the benefits Typescript provide is very valuable as mentioned before. Besides this, Typescript also enables certain default Macros such as the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>?.</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>??</code> operators where the expression is discontinued if the base item is <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>undefined</code> or <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>null</code>.</p> <h3 id="html-text-area-history-events" data-v-b8113688><span id="html-text-area-history-events" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>HTML Text area history events<a href="#html-text-area-history-events" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>While working on adding a custom undo and redo stack for CATcher, I learnt about how HTML manages it's build in undo and redo feature in it's text area. Initially it was rather mysterious on when and how data and information is stored in the text area which enables them to do features and like undo and redo out of the box. I discovered how such features will be nullified when the value of the component is manually changed via code. However, when using libraries like the Markdown Toolbar, the history is still preserved.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>It turns out that the way these is achieved is via events specified by a specific set of platfomr APIs that is accessible via the Javascript method <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>document.execCommand</code>. In this case, storing of history is done via the Internet Explorer Command Idenfifiers found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/hh801229(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#EndUndoUnit" data-v-b8113688>here</a>. Specifically, users can wrap the changes made to the text-area via 2 commands <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>ms-beginUndoUnit</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>ms-endUndoUnit</code>. These 2 tags essentially serves as a &quot;mutex&quot; where changes done to the text area during this period is viewed as a singular change instead of multiple changes as well as the changes being stored in the history stack of the default html elements.</p> <h3 id="javascript-events" data-v-b8113688><span id="javascript-events" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Javascript Events<a href="#javascript-events" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>In a lot of the Javascript components involving input output (IO), how events are being propagated is quite important to understand. Specifically, how each event is &quot;bubbled&quot; and &quot;captured&quot; through different components and how to control the flow of such events. In details, suppose a user click on a certain component (let's say a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>div</code> tag). This component could be located in many different components and tags. So if a user click on that <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>div</code>, how should it's parent component react to that event?
There are generally 2 forms of argument on how the behavior should be implemented.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Firstly, it is the capturing of events, where the &quot;click&quot; will be captured from the most outest parent component slowly to the target component that was actually clicked.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Secondly, there is the idea of bubbling, where events will originate from the source of the click (target component) and slowly &quot;bubbles&quot; up to it's parent components.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Javascript generally implements both of this in 2 phases. When some event is going to trigger, it first &quot;captures&quot; all the relevant component and then it creates a event which &quot;bubbles&quot; back up. For more details regarding this behaviors as well as controlling them, I referred to the link <a href="https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing" data-v-b8113688>here</a> for reference</p> <h3 id="graphql" data-v-b8113688><span id="graphql" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>GraphQL<a href="#graphql" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>Traditionally, interations with servers are usually done via REST APIs using POST and GET to retrive information. However, the problem here is the additional information that is unrelated to the what the user is actually want. For instance, if someone wants to query for certain objects on the server, information that is not important is still retrieved due to the fixed API responses.
A much more desirable behavior is to supply the users with exactly what the users want in a singular, compact request. This is where GraphQl comes in. GraphQL enables the clients to have the freedom to select data that he or she needs and allow a much faster and fluid development compared to traditional REST.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>A specific GraphQL server is setup on the host to expose the data as a GraphQL API to the clients. This server will follow the graphQL requirements and allow clients to freely query for the specific information needed. CATcher and WATcher specifically uses the Github GraphQL server to query for information. Due to a rate limit of page size=100, we still need to make multiple requests fetch all the required information.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Github GraphQL explorer: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer" data-v-b8113688>Explorer</a></p> <h3 id="rxjs" data-v-b8113688><span id="rxjs" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>RXJS<a href="#rxjs" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>A major difference in UI/UX developement is the need to handle interactions with users. Things like waiting for data from servers, updating elements based on changes can be rather difficult and tiring to code out using the asynchronous programming methods. RxJs adds Observers patterns to the code while abstracting away all the intricacies as well as asynchronous code. This enables developers to easily leverage observer patterns while maintaining a clean and readable code.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" data-v-b8113688><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-b8113688><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-b8113688><!----> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-b8113688><h2 id="wong-chee-hong" data-v-b8113688><span id="wong-chee-hong" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Wong Chee Hong<a href="#wong-chee-hong" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h2> <div data-v-b8113688><h2 id="angular-essentials" data-v-b8113688><span id="angular-essentials" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Angular Essentials<a href="#angular-essentials" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h2> <p data-v-b8113688>I had contributed to CATcher as part of IWM, but I have never really approached the Angular aspects of the project.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Essentially, the core ideas behind Angular involves:</p> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688>Components, a TypeScript class with <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>@Component</code> decorator, an HTML template and styles.
<ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688>The decorator accepts parameters that help Angular know which HTML file is the component's template and which css file is the component's styles.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>The decorator also accepts a parameter that is the component's selector, which is how we can reuse this component as an HTML element in other HTML files.</li></ul></li> <li data-v-b8113688>An HTML template that instructs Angular how to render the component</li> <li data-v-b8113688>An optional set of CSS styles that define the appearance of the template's HTML elements</li></ul> <p data-v-b8113688>The other key concepts include event bindings and property binding that link the template to the TypeScript class. Knowing these essentials allowed me to fix <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/pull/57" data-v-b8113688>WATcher PR#57</a>.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Another key part of Angular is its Dependency Injection system and services. Angular allows us to provide dependencies at different levels of the application, and how the dependencies are instantiated.</p> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688>For example, when you providing a service at the root level, Angular creates a single, shared instance of the service and injects it into any class that asks for it.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Also, it seems like most of WATcher and CATcher's services are provided at the root level.</li></ul> <p data-v-b8113688>Finally, as part of fixing &quot;<a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/pull/92" data-v-b8113688>Remove label-filter-bar as module export #92</a>&quot;, I also learned about how related components are organized and grouped into modules. Each Module are self-contained and provide a certain set of functionality and components related to that module, thereby achieving separation of concerns.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Resources:</p> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688><a href="https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular" data-v-b8113688>https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular</a></li> <li data-v-b8113688><a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection" data-v-b8113688>https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection</a></li> <li data-v-b8113688><a href="https://angular.io/guide/ngmodules" data-v-b8113688>https://angular.io/guide/ngmodules</a></li></ul> <h2 id="e2e-testing-with-playwright" data-v-b8113688><span id="e2e-testing-with-playwright" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>E2E Testing with Playwright<a href="#e2e-testing-with-playwright" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h2> <p data-v-b8113688>After having 2 separate hotfixes pushed in a single semester, I started to look more deeply into ensuring the robustness of our application. During these 2 hotfixes, bugs were only uncovered during manual testing. However, it is time consuming to conduct manual tests, and we need to find a way to automate it. E2E tests simulate user interactions such as clicks and typing and is a useful way to ensure our end-product is performing as expected.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>During this semester, one of the high priority issues was to migrate our E2E solution away from Protractor. As such, I have investigated Cypress and Playwright as two potential E2E solutions.</p> <h4 id="mocking-services" data-v-b8113688><span id="mocking-services" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Mocking services<a href="#mocking-services" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>When performing migration from Protractor to Playwright, I learned about the different strategies E2E tests can be conducted. Typically, we would want to conduct E2E tests against our production server, since that is what our end users will be using. However, since CATcher depends alot on GitHub's API for its functionality, we are unable to perform automated tests against GitHub. A second strategy would be to mock the functions that hit GitHub's API, and we would test solely the functionalities and behaviours of the app. This let me realized that there is a test vs production version of CATcher.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>I have also looked into whether it is possible to perform E2E testing against the production server, since one of the bugs fixed in the hotfixes can only be caught if we did not adopt a mocking strategy. One of the key feasibility concerns I had with testing against the GitHub API was simulating user authentication. This was because authenticating with GitHub requires multi-factor authentication, something that is difficult to achieve with automated E2E testing. Some potential solutions to bypassing MFA would be to use TOTP, which can be generated programmatically. More research will be needed in this area.</p> <h4 id="aspects-learnt" data-v-b8113688><span id="aspects-learnt" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Aspects Learnt<a href="#aspects-learnt" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688>Configuring and setting up Playwright for a project.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Learned about how Playwright/Cypress/Protractor identifies and interacts with HTML elements using selectors.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Learned about how CATcher API calls are mocked during E2E testing</li></ul> <p data-v-b8113688>Resources:</p> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688><a href="https://playwright.dev" data-v-b8113688>https://playwright.dev</a></li> <li data-v-b8113688><a href="https://www.cypress.io/" data-v-b8113688>https://www.cypress.io/</a></li> <li data-v-b8113688><a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/539" data-v-b8113688>This pull request by ptvrajsk documenting how he implemented E2E with Protractor</a></li></ul> <h2 id="github-actions" data-v-b8113688><span id="github-actions" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Github Actions<a href="#github-actions" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h2> <p data-v-b8113688>I also picked up Github Actions when contributing to the CI/CD pipeline in <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/pull/81" data-v-b8113688>Enable linting in Github workflow #81</a>.

However, I realised that one of the key aspects of frontend frameworks, namely reactivity, was in fact the main drivers of development of such frameworks in the first place!</p> <p data-v-b8113688>In fact, even React were originally championing the idea of Class Components in order to isolate various web components into areas or responsibility, following rule number 1 of Software Engineering: Single Responsibility. However, while React is largely unopinionated in how you structure your code with regards to the coupling of business logic and HTML, Angular differs by dictating where and how you structure your components.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Angular separates components into modules which comprise of 3 to 4 files:</p> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688>Components, which are necessarily TypeScript classes which have the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>@Component</code> decorator;</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Templates, which dictate the HTML that is produced and rendered by the component;</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Styles, which dictate the type of styling to apply to the component.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>Module, which indicate the modules or services that are to be imported by the component. Interestingly,</li></ul> <p data-v-b8113688>On the other hand, React only dictates that class components should produce some sort of HTML using the render function. Even this is removed with the introduction of Functional Components that are simply functions which render and produce some HTML. React introduces hooks which are often used by developers to manage some state at the component level, using functions with side effects.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Each method has its positives and negatives. Because of its opinionated nature, Angular makes it easy to standardize frontend coding standards and pattern across an entire enterprise, making it an apt choice to use as a tool for OSS development. On the other hand, React allows you to develop code more quickly, with more attention needed to be paid at the rendering lifecycles in order to let the Virtual DOM know when a particular component needs to be rendered again. On top of this, Angular wholely separates business logic from rendered HTML, whereas React takes the does not make this distinction.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Another key point is how React and Angular differentiate in providing context (sharing or passing down state between different branches of the DOM tree). React has its own Context API that is used to share some sort of state between different components, whereas Angular does this by the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>providers</code> declaration in the module folder, which results in a set of singletons that are shared by components that exist below it in the tree.</p> <h3 id="rxjs-2" data-v-b8113688><span id="rxjs-2" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>RxJS<a href="#rxjs-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>I also picked up RxJS along the way, which was Angular's answer to creating reactive components. RxJS essentially deals with asynchronous pipe/filter, publisher/subscriber behavior which allows values to change and other components or functions to subscribe to these changes. This works considering Angular's Change Detection strategy which I will explain later.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>In comparison, React introduced and adopted hooks to encapsulate the behavior of having to rerender. React does this by operating on a Virtual DOM, and appropriately rerendering components and their children in patches when a change was detected. On the other hand, Angular does not have any abstraction to operate and rerender components whose state have changed. Instead, Angular uses a Change Detection Strategy which can be configured by the user (either onPush or Default). Angular Change Detection works by using Zone.js and activating after every async action performed. CD traversal starts at the root component (usually App) and works its way down the component tree updating the DOM as needed. What's happening under the hood is that browser events are registered into Zone.js - Angular's mechanism for orchestrating async events - which emits changes after initial template bindings are created.

Previously, only knowing the React.js framework, Vue.js is a handy addition to my arsenal. The basics of Vue.js was rather simple to pick up. Reading the <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html" data-v-b8113688>Vue.js documentation</a>, and referencing examples of already implemented Vue components in MarkBind, I quickly understood the use of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>&lt;template&gt;</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>&lt;style&gt;</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>&lt;script&gt;</code>. Through <a href="https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/development/writingComponents.html" data-v-b8113688>Markbind's Developer Guide</a>, I learnt how to easily create different kinds of Vue components and implement them in MarkBind.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>As I implemented my first Vue component, <a href="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2193" data-v-b8113688>Add autogenerated breadcrumbs component #2193</a>, I delved deeper into Vue, exploring the use of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>data()</code>, to manage the internal state of Vue components, and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>methods()</code> to define methods to be used within the component. I also learnt more about Vue lifecycle hooks, in which I used the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>mounted</code> hook to allow the Breadcrumb component to query the SiteNav to figure out the hierarchy of the current page.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>As I continued working on improving MarkBind's frontend, I learnt more about Vue's <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>&lt;transition&gt;</code> component, in particular using transition hooks. While I was working on <a href="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2184" data-v-b8113688>Fix Quiz expanding between questions #2184</a>, I came realize how useful these hooks were, helping to create seamless transitions for different situations. I relied heavily on <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html#javascript-hooks" data-v-b8113688>Vue.js documentation</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59632929/vue-js-animation-enter-after-leave-and-not-simultaneously" data-v-b8113688>StackOverflow Posts</a> as I was researching about Vue's transition hooks.</p> <h3 id="document-object-model-dom-manipulation" data-v-b8113688><span id="document-object-model-dom-manipulation" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation<a href="#document-object-model-dom-manipulation" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>When I was working on implementing the new Breadcrumb and Collapse/Expand All Buttons components, I had to extensively use <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>Document.querySelector()</code> and other related methods. I was new to this and had to do some research about how the methods work, what happens if the object cannot be found and handling edge cases. By practicing these while implementing the two components mentioned above, I believe that I have become more proficient in doing this. As a side-effect of this, I have also gained a deeper understanding on how the DOM works.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Resources:</p> <ul data-v-b8113688><li data-v-b8113688><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/" data-v-b8113688>Documentation</a></li></ul> <h3 id="jest-vue-test-utils" data-v-b8113688><span id="jest-vue-test-utils" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Jest/Vue Test Utils<a href="#jest-vue-test-utils" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>Jest and Vue Test Utils were something that I was new to coming into MarkBind. MarkBind uses Jest together with Vue Test Utils for its snapshot tests, which test Vue components against their expected snapshots.

Resources I used included the Markbind dev page regarding <a href="https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/design/serverSideRendering.html" data-v-b8113688>SSR</a> of course, the <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html" data-v-b8113688>Vue Official Documentation</a> and <a href="https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/design/serverSideRendering.html" data-v-b8113688>another Vue tutorial</a>.
This was especially useful when dealing with Vue templates in one of my PRs about jQuery, which logged an warning since there was a script tag in the template.

<a href="https://vuejs.org/api/options-state.html" data-v-b8113688>Options API</a>. However, working on the project allowed me to delve deeper into
the intricacies of Vue and how to fully utilize its features.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.1.1 MVVM Architecture Pattern</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>Vue.js focuses on the 'ViewModel' layer of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. This is because it connects
the Views and Models via 2-way data bindings. In this case, the view is the DOM (Document Object Model), and the models are
the plain JavaScript objects.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.1.2 Leveraging Template Refs for Custom Behaviors</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>While Vue has a rendering model that abstracts away direct manipulation of the DOM, sometimes it is necessary to have access
to the DOM to programmatically control an element. Hence, Vue gives us access to <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>$refs</code>, which are similar to
<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>document.querySelector('.element')</code> in JavaScript, but are more efficient as they give direct access to the element needed
rather than returning the first element that matches the given selector. This allowed me to implement custom behaviour such as
<a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1860" data-v-b8113688>pinning the file title</a> within Vue.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.1.3 Reusability with Custom Directives</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>Reuse of code is an essential concept in software engineering, which is why Vue offers custom directives.
Custom directives allow the reuse of logic that involves low-level DOM access. They are basically objects containing
lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>One of the custom directives that RepoSense was already utilizing was a plugin called
<a href="https://github.com/Akryum/vue-observe-visibility/tree/next" data-v-b8113688><code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>vue-observe-visibility</code></a>. This made use of the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry" data-v-b8113688>IntersectionObserverEntry Web API</a> to observe
whether an element is in view and execute a function accordingly.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>During my work on the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1860" data-v-b8113688>pin file title PR</a>, I encountered a bug where
tooltips appeared out of the viewport when at the top of the page. As the file title would be pinned to the top of the
page, this issue needed to be resolved before my PR could be merged. To address this, I thought of using a custom
directive, and I utilized the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>vue-observe-visibility</code> directive to modify the CSS of the tooltip to be bottom-aligned
based on visibility changes. While this solution was successful, we required more customization as the tooltip needed
to move back to being top-aligned when scrolling up. I eventually used template refs to address this issue, but this
experience allowed me to understand better about custom directives.</p> <h4 id="1-2-vuex" data-v-b8113688><span id="1-2-vuex" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>1.2 Vuex<a href="#1-2-vuex" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue that serves as the centralized source for all components.

enforces rules to ensure that the state can only be mutated in a predictable manner.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.2.1 Single Source of Truth</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>During my work on a <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1939" data-v-b8113688>PR</a> to differentiate between authors when using
the 'merge group' option in RepoSense, I faced an issue with unsynchronised data copies. Initially, I had stored the
colors assigned to authors in both a local <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>data()</code> variable and the Vuex store. To resolve this, I employed <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>mapState</code>
as a Vue <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>computed</code> property to access the Vuex state from Vue components. This approach allowed me to re-evaluate the
computed property every time the data changed, which triggered DOM updates and allowed a single source of truth.
However, relying on the global store singleton could potentially be considered an anti-pattern as it would make the code
difficult to test.</p> <h4 id="1-3-javascript" data-v-b8113688><span id="1-3-javascript" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>1.3 JavaScript<a href="#1-3-javascript" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.3.1 Dot vs Bracket Notation for Accessing Object Properties:</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>The dot notation (<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>objectName.propertyName</code>) is commonly used to access properties in a clean manner. However, it limits
property identifiers to alphanumeric characters, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>_</code>, and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>$</code>. On the other hand, the bracket notation
(<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>objectName['propertyName']</code>) can use all UTF-8 characters in property names or even variables that finally resolve to
a string. This notation is useful when the property name is only known during runtime, as in this
<a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1860" data-v-b8113688>PR</a> where <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>this.$refs[file.path]</code> is used because the reference to
<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>file.path</code> is only resolved based on the file being interacted with.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.3.2 ES6 String Interpolation for Cleaner Code</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>ES6 introduced template strings as a concise and readable way to insert values into strings. In contrast, the string
concatenation approach can be harder to read and edit, and requires creating multiple strings that need to be put
together. Moreover, string concatenation would take up more memory and computation compared to creating just one string.</p> <h4 id="1-4-typescript" data-v-b8113688><span id="1-4-typescript" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>1.4 TypeScript<a href="#1-4-typescript" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language that allows for classes, interfaces, and inheritance support in

Therefore, we decided to migrate our codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript to align our frontend with our OOP Java backend.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.4.1 Class vs Interface for Typing</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>When working on <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1852" data-v-b8113688>my first PR</a> for defining Vue prop types explicitly,
I initially used classes in TypeScript. However, after gaining more knowledge about TypeScript, I realized that
interfaces are more suitable for type-checking at compile time. Interfaces have less overhead since they do not exist at
runtime and are erased when the code is transpiled to JS. Although classes can define methods relevant to class objects,
this feature was not useful for us. In a <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1965" data-v-b8113688>later PR</a>, we decided to
switch to using an interface to improve the performance of the frontend.</p> <h4 id="1-5-pug" data-v-b8113688><span id="1-5-pug" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>1.5 Pug<a href="#1-5-pug" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>Pug is a templating language that makes it easier to write reusable HTML components with cleaner syntax.

It helps reduce repetition in CSS and saves programming time by
providing features like variables, mixins, imports, and inheritance. A Sass pre-processor transpiles Sass code into
standard CSS as browsers can only understand plain CSS code.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>1.6.1 Choosing between Placeholders and Mixins</strong></p> <p data-v-b8113688>The difference between mixins and placeholders is that placeholders consolidate mutually-shared code, whereas mixins just
assign the properties to the individual classes — along with whatever was specific to that class. Because of this, it’s
preferred to use placeholders. But since placeholders aren’t able to take parameters, it’s better to use mixins in such
cases.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>I had to decide between placeholders and mixins when trying to consolidate the code required for a tooltip tail, and assign
it along with some specific properties depending on whether the tooltip was top-aligned or bottom-aligned. Hence, I made use
of placeholders for this as they group together mutually-shared code. In another
<a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1979" data-v-b8113688>PR</a>, I used mixins to standardize the fonts used throughout the

Additionally, it has a toggle to switch between the Composition API and Options API for each page of the documentation, allowing people who are already familiar with one to easily pick up the other.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Here are some of the main things that I learnt:</p> <h4 id="importance-of-computed-properties" data-v-b8113688><span id="importance-of-computed-properties" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Importance of computed properties<a href="#importance-of-computed-properties" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>In RepoSense, there are many properties that we need to calculate/obtain when other properties are changed. For instance, in the zoom panel, we need to maintain a list of commits to be displayed. This list needs to be re-calculated based on other properties, such as the author that is currently selected, the filters applied to the commits (e.g. only show commits in <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>.js</code> files), etc. In Vue, such properties should be implemented as a <strong data-v-b8113688>computed property</strong> under the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>computed</code> object in the export.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>The main advantage of computed properties are that they are <strong data-v-b8113688>cached</strong>, and are only re-computed when one of their reactive dependencies are changed. In the above example, this would be equivalent to our list of displayed commits only being re-computed when the currently selected author is changed, or a filter is added/removed. This <strong data-v-b8113688>significantly improves performance</strong>, as if we were to implement the computation of a list in a normal method, it will be re-computed on <em data-v-b8113688>every</em> re-render, even if the re-render was triggered by an unrelated reactive item - resulting in the unnecessary re-computation of the same value. In a frontend application like RepoSense's reports where there are many such properties, utilising Vue's computed properties provides a much needed performance boost.</p> <h4 id="avoiding-direct-manipulation-of-dom" data-v-b8113688><span id="avoiding-direct-manipulation-of-dom" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Avoiding direct manipulation of DOM<a href="#avoiding-direct-manipulation-of-dom" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>One of the main advantages of using a framework like Vue is that certain aspects relating to modifying the DOM are abstracted away from the user. Vue handles reactivity for the user, by updating the DOM when reactive state is mutated. Hence, problems can arise when users bypass this functionality of Vue and manually modify the DOM within Vue components. This is because Vue has no knowledge of these modifications, resulting in potential modifications clashing with Vue's mutation of the DOM.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1866" data-v-b8113688>This PR</a> involved deprecating the use of a method that manually modified the DOM in order to toggle the show/hide state of commits. This method of toggling commits involved a manual mutation of a CSS class, while there was a synchronous method that calculated and updated the number of shown/hidden commits based on this CSS class, which was stored in a reactive variable. However, since Vue's updates to the DOM are asynchronous, this resulted in the variable always being one action behind the 'true' state, which caused an incorrect display of the show/hide all commit messages text. This problem was fixed by working 'within' Vue - modifying a reactive variable on toggle change, and letting Vue handle the DOM mutation. Hence, we should always try to solve the problem within the framework, and try as best as possible to avoid direct mutations of the DOM.</p> <h4 id="deep-vs-shallow-copy-when-passing-data" data-v-b8113688><span id="deep-vs-shallow-copy-when-passing-data" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Deep vs Shallow copy when passing data<a href="#deep-vs-shallow-copy-when-passing-data" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>When passing data between components, care should always be taken with regard to how the data is passed, and the consequences of any mutations of that data.

The <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress" data-v-b8113688>Cypress docs</a> is a great resource for learning how to write tests, and was the main resource that I used when learning.</p> <h4 id="test-isolation" data-v-b8113688><span id="test-isolation" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Test Isolation<a href="#test-isolation" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>One of the main things that confused me at first was why Cypress was configured to 'start from scratch' for each test case, i.e. it starts from the beginning of the RepoSense report/from a reload of the entire app for every single test case. After reading the corresponding page of the <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-isolation" data-v-b8113688>docs</a>, I learnt that this was important to ensure the consistency &amp; usefulness of each individual test case. By resetting the DOM state before each test, it ensures that each test functions independently, which in turn ensures that the running of any test does not impact the outcome of other tests. Otherwise, there might be a scenario where test case A passes, but causes a change that results in test case B failing. In this case, the results of the tests might be misleading, as the failure was a result of actions not confined within the test case itself.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Along a similar line, testing of functionality should be isolated whenever possible. One of the test cases that I wrote was to test that the toggle state of a file persisted after sort. My original idea was to toggle the state of the first file, then change the sort order from 'descending' to 'ascending' and checking the toggle state of the last file. However, this implementation relies on the correctness of the sort functionality, and hence an error in the sorting function might result in this test case failing, which would be misleading. Therefore, in the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/commit/1dd4ab44a1981023169f65ead4b24588c6344052#diff-c6e7d02d4131f1788f7ec1dc99e38edcee54f91e0774bc821361cc55d307b769R121" data-v-b8113688>actual implementation</a>, the file is tracked by file path and searched for after the sort, which isolates this test case from the correctness of the sort functionality.</p> <h3 id="typescript-3" data-v-b8113688><span id="typescript-3" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>TypeScript<a href="#typescript-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <h4 id="importance-of-enums" data-v-b8113688><span id="importance-of-enums" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Importance of enums<a href="#importance-of-enums" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>TypeScript <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html" data-v-b8113688>supports enums</a> similar to other languages like Java. Having enums is very convenient when you want to restrict a variable to a certain set of values, instead of an entire type. For instance, in RepoSense, there are many instances where variables only take specific values, such as a sort type only having valid values equal to &quot;groupByNone&quot;, &quot;groupByRepos&quot; and &quot;groupByAuthors&quot;.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>In this instance, typing the variable as a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>string</code> would technically be correct, and it would detect errors in the scenario where the variable is set to other types. However, it does not detect errors in the case where the variable is an invalid string, such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>GroupByNone</code> or <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>groupByNon</code>. This can easily occur due to a developer error, as the string is also manually referenced throughout the codebase (e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>filterType = 'groupByNone'</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>if (filterType === 'groupByNone'))</code>) etc. If a typo was made in one of these references, it would still compile properly without warnings, but the bug would exist in production. Using enums helps us twofold - first, we can replace all manual references with the enum instead (e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>filterType = FilterGroupSelection.GroupByNone</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>if (filterType === FilterGroupSelection.GroupByNone)</code>), which would prevent any individual typos (and a typo such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>FilterGroupSelection.GroupByNon</code> will fail to compile as the type does not exist), and secondly, if we want to change the string itself, we just have to change it in the enum definition instead of everywhere in the codebase.</p> <h4 id="type-predicates" data-v-b8113688><span id="type-predicates" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Type Predicates<a href="#type-predicates" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>Often, we have objects of similar types that work closely together (for instance, both stored in the same array), and we might have to distinguish between them in certain circumstances. For instance, in RepoSense, when we initially read the commits from the report generated by the backend, we store these commits as a certain type, but in the frontend we process these raw commits to add certain attributes to form a different type that inherits from the former. Hence, in the codebase, it is important to distinguish between these two types.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>In order to narrow the type (e.g. if we have an object that can be either one of the two types but we want to be certain which one it is), we can use <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates" data-v-b8113688>Type predicates</a>, which narrows down the object type <strong data-v-b8113688>based on the compatability of that object</strong>. For instance, in RepoSense, I used <a href="https://github.com/vvidday/RepoSense/blob/c9048f56a2a2c67b559c89b50b05b4db2bb5e066/frontend/src/types/types.ts#L30" data-v-b8113688>this type predicate</a> to differentiate between the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>Commit</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>DailyCommit</code> type. The <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>Commit</code> type extends <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>DailyCommit</code>, but has an optional field <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>deletions</code>. The type predicate checks whether the field <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>deletions</code> exists on the object, and uses that to determine the type of the provided object. This is used in code where we have a bunch of objects which are minimally <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>Commit</code>s, but we are not sure if they are <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>DailyCommit</code>s. The type predicate allows us to distinguish this, and therefore safely access the appropriate objects (that have the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>deletions</code> field) as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>DailyCommit</code>s.</p> <h4 id="type-inference-vs-explicit-types" data-v-b8113688><span id="type-inference-vs-explicit-types" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Type inference vs Explicit types<a href="#type-inference-vs-explicit-types" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>One difference between TypeScript and traditionally strongly typed languages is the <strong data-v-b8113688>type inference</strong> feature of the TypeScript compiler. In TypeScript, in certain cases such as function return types, the compiler can infer the type of the return object from the code itself without explicit declaration from the programmer. For instance, consider the following code:</p> <pre data-v-b8113688><code class="hljs typescript" data-v-b8113688><span data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-function" data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-keyword" data-v-b8113688>function</span> <span class="hljs-title" data-v-b8113688>double</span>(<span class="hljs-params" data-v-b8113688>x: <span class="hljs-built_in" data-v-b8113688>number</span></span>) </span>{

</span><span data-v-b8113688>}
</span></code></pre><p data-v-b8113688>TypeScript automatically infers the return type to be <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>number</code> in this case. Of course, we can define the return type explicitly:</p> <pre data-v-b8113688><code class="hljs typescript" data-v-b8113688><span data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-function" data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-keyword" data-v-b8113688>function</span> <span class="hljs-title" data-v-b8113688>double</span>(<span class="hljs-params" data-v-b8113688>x: <span class="hljs-built_in" data-v-b8113688>number</span></span>): <span class="hljs-title" data-v-b8113688>number</span> </span>{

</span><span data-v-b8113688>}
</span></code></pre><p data-v-b8113688>Which in this case would be functionally equivalent, with a small difference being explicit declaration reduces overhead, as the compiler doesn't need to do the inference. However, aside from that, at first glance explicit declaration <em data-v-b8113688>seems</em> redundant, as the compiler can do inference. However, solely relying on inference can be prone to bugs, because the compiler assumes that your function definition is correct. Consider this example:</p> <pre data-v-b8113688><code class="hljs typescript" data-v-b8113688><span data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-function" data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-keyword" data-v-b8113688>function</span> <span class="hljs-title" data-v-b8113688>double</span>(<span class="hljs-params" data-v-b8113688>x: <span class="hljs-built_in" data-v-b8113688>number</span></span>) </span>{

</span><span data-v-b8113688>}
</span></code></pre><p data-v-b8113688>Although the above is an obvious bug (assuming we want double to return a number), the TypeScript compiler doesn't know what the user wants, and so happily infers the return type as string. Essentially, the compiler will never throw an error on inference, because it assumes the user's function implementation is correct (as it doesn't know the user's intention).
However, if we know that we want the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>double</code> function to return a number, and use an explicit return type declaration, the same code will result in an error:</p> <pre data-v-b8113688><code class="hljs typescript" data-v-b8113688><span data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-function" data-v-b8113688><span class="hljs-keyword" data-v-b8113688>function</span> <span class="hljs-title" data-v-b8113688>double</span>(<span class="hljs-params" data-v-b8113688>x: <span class="hljs-built_in" data-v-b8113688>number</span></span>): <span class="hljs-title" data-v-b8113688>number</span> </span>{

However there are still new things I learned while working on the onboarding task and review PRs:
    1. **Angular Pipes**:
        - It is preferred to use pipes over manually transforming the data
            - To illustrate:
                ``` html
                &lt;!-- Function --&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;.toUpperCase()&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;!-- Pipe --&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;{{ Hello World | uppercase }}&lt;/p&gt;
                ```
            - better performance: as pure pipes only execute their `transform` method when the underlying value changes.
            - reduce code re-use: pipes can be declared once and used throughout the application.

        - There are 2 different types of pipes
            - pure pipe: only runs when the underlying value changes.
            - impure pipe: runs every Digest cycle / in almost every change-detection cycle.
                - To create an impure pipe, set `pure: false` in the pipe's declaration.
                ```javascript
                @Pipe({
                    name: 'myPipe',
                    pure : false

            If the input to the pipe is an object with nested fields, if there are any changes to the nested fields, a pure pipe will not detect the change.
            This can be fixed by creating an impure pipe, but the performance of an impure pipe is significantly worse as `transform` executes a lot more frequently, which is especially worse when input to the pipe is large (eg. a list).

When reviewing PRs on TEAMMATES, I learned about the various global styles Bootstrap provides.
For example:
- Grid system, `col` &amp; `row`: built upon CSS's flexbox architecture; Bootstrap provides functionality to control how the column / row changes.
    - example: `class=&quot;col-6 col-lg-4&quot;`: 50% wide when device specs &lt; 992px (ie. `lg` grid breakpoint) and 1/3 of width on devices specs &gt;= 992px
    - 6 default grid tiers: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, ...
    - if no unit/number provided, bootstrap will distribute the space equally (eg.`class=&quot;col&quot;`)

It is preferred to use Bootstrap classes where possible rather than creating our own responsive CSS.

Additionally, I gained first-hand experience working with the Hibernate ORM.
</code></pre> <h4 id="hibernate-java-orm-framework" data-v-b8113688><span id="hibernate-java-orm-framework" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Hibernate (Java ORM Framework)<a href="#hibernate-java-orm-framework" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <pre data-v-b8113688><code data-v-b8113688>In particular, v9 migration uses Hibernate (an ORM framework for Java environments) for TEAMMATES.

Over the course of the project, I learned some of Hibernate's concepts:
- states in a Hibernate session (Transient state: not yet attached to a session, Persistent state: associated with a session)
- **Persistence Context** &amp; cache-memory / caching in Hibernate (including how the first-level cache, second-level cache and managed entities work)
    - Persistence Context: it is a staging area that sits between the code in TEAMMATES and the PostgreSQL database; the concept is implemented in Hibernate `session`.
    - Hibernate's `session` manages all the data loaded into it, keeps track of any changes to the data and is responsible for updating the data in the database later.
    - Managed Entity: a record in the database that's been loaded into a Hibernate session, and is managed by that session (ie. track any change to the entity and updates database accordingly).

- flushing the session (synchronises the objects in memory / cache with the database)
    - Avoid manually forcing the session to flush
    - Hibernate has no guarantees of when the sesison will be flushed to

- **Annotations** (Since Hibernate implements JPA specification, Hibernate supports any environment that uses Jakarta Persistance Annotations on top of providing their own Hibernate Annotations.)
    - Jakarta Persistence Annotations: `@Entity` (specifies a POJO as a JPA entity), `@Id` (specifies a field as the Primary Key), `@Column` (specifies details of a table's column, eg. `nullable`), `@Table` (to change table/relation name)
        ```java
        @Entity
        @Table(name = &quot;DeadlineExtensions&quot;)
        class DeadlineExtension {
            @Id
            private UUID id;
        }
        ```
    - Jakarta Persistance Mapping Annotations (`@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@JoinColumn`) to create relationships between entities.
        ```java
        // Bi-directional many-to-one relationship.
        // 1 feedback session to many deadline extensions.
        @Entity
        @Table(name = &quot;DeadlineExtensions&quot;)
        class DeadlineExtension {
            @ManyToOne
            @JoinColumn(name = &quot;sessionId&quot;, nullable = false)
            private FeedbackSession feedbackSession;
        }

        @Entity
        @Table(name = &quot;FeedbackSessions&quot;)
        class FeedbackSession {
            @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;feedbackSession&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)
            @Fetch(FetchMode.JOIN)
            private List&lt;DeadlineExtension&gt; deadlineExtensions;
        }

For the v9 migration, I learned and gained experience with using these queries to fetch entity / entities from the PostgreSQL database.
Such complex queries (built using `CriteriaBuilder`, `CriteriaQuery` and `TypedQuery` classes) include:
- using clauses (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`),
- joining multiple relations (`JOIN`) and
- conditional conjunctions (`and`, `equal`, `greaterThan`, ...) provided by the API.

Example of a complex query:
```java
    // parameters: feedbackSessionId, userId

    CriteriaBuilder cb = HibernateUtil.getCriteriaBuilder();
    // specifies that the query should return DeadlineExtension object(s)

Over the course of the module when working with TEAMMATES, I realised the importance of testing and gained much valuable experience writing test cases (unit and integration tests in particular).

Additionally, I learned to use the following testing frameworks:
- **TestNG** (Automation Testing framework)
    I mainly used TestNG's Annotations to aid in writing unit and integration tests on TEAMMATES.
    For example:
    - `@Test`: to specify that the method is a test case.
    - `@BeforeMethod` and `@AfterMethod`: to specify that the annotated method must be executed before / after all `@Test` methods / test cases in the class.
    - `@BeforeClass`: to specify that the annotated method must be called before running all test cases in that class.
- **Mockito** (Mocking Framework)
    Mockito was introduced in TEAMMATES to make mocking and stubbing in unit tests easier.
    Mocking in Mockito:
    - When Mockito creates a mock, the object is completely &quot;fake&quot; (completely ); it never executes real invocations of the mocked class.

    I used Mockito to mock classes that the class being tested on has a dependency with, stub method calls (with `when`, `thenReturn`, `thenThrow`, etc) and verify interactions with the mocked class (with `verify` method).
        ```java
        MyClass expectedObject = new MyClass(&quot;id&quot;);

        myMockedClass = mock(MyClass.class);
        // define the behavior of mocked class: instead of executing the real method, the mocked method only returns the expected object
        when(myMockedClass.getObject(&quot;id&quot;)).thenReturn(expectedObject);

        // verify number of calls to stubbed method with mocked class
        verify(myMockedClass, times(1)).getObject(&quot;id&quot;);
        ```

    Additionally, I researched other concepts Mockito provides: `spy` (for partial mocking) and mocking of static methods (`mockStatic`), but never had a chance to work with them.
    - Spy:
        - partial mocking is done for Spy; ie. in comparison to mocks which don't execute the stubbed method (&quot;only fake object exists&quot;), for spy: some parts will use real method invocations (&quot;a real object exists and we are spy-ing on it&quot;).

    - Mocking of static methods:
        - in older versions of Mockito, it's not possible to mock static methods, but with PowerMock (a third-party tool), it is possible in newer versions.
        - instead of `mock`, use `mockStatic` to create a mock for a static class.

    - `verify`
        - I initially ran into some issues with `verify` and did more research into the cause;
            In the Action-layer tests, since the mocked logic object is shared with all action test classes, the mocked object accumulates the count of calls to any of the mocked logic methods across multiple test cases.
            Work-arounds:
                1. create the mock whenever a new test case is called (like how it's done for logic and db layer classes) or
                2. use `clearInvocations` method to clear to reset the invocation counts for a mock, between test cases.
        - Takeaway: A mock will keep track of all its past invocations.

    - Mocking void methods:
        - Mockito's default behaviour for void methods: `doNothing` (ie. the mock does nothing, will not execute the real method)
        - If void method has some complex behaviour: can use `doAnswer` (to define custom behaviour) or invoke the real method (`doCallRealMethod`, but this creates a dependency in unit test case)

would have the attribute <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>description</code> but not <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>quantity</code>, and for records of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>ClassB</code>, they would not have the attribute <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>description</code>

For instance, in the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>Joined Table</code> strategy,
each subclass will have its own table, and when querying, it is joined with the parent class' table. This was one of the reasons why
<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>SingleTable</code> inheritance was ultimately chosen for <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>FeedbackQuestion</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>FeedbackResponse</code> entities, as they had many subclasses.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Baeldung's <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-inheritance" data-v-b8113688>guide</a> on inheritance strategies was extremely helpful to me in understanding the differences between them, and the tradeoffs one needs to consider when choosing among them.</p> <h2 id="testing-2" data-v-b8113688><span id="testing-2" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Testing<a href="#testing-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h2> <h3 id="context-3" data-v-b8113688><span id="context-3" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Context<a href="#context-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>Prior to working on TEAMMATES, the only exposure to software testing I had was in CS2103T. Working on the migration to postgresql involved writing tests, and
through that I've gained a slightly better understanding of the different types of tests, and a much greater appreciation of the importance of tests. When
migrating the system to postgres, having the old test cases provided us with some reassurance that the changes we made to the system would not impact the
existing functionalities, which is absolutely essential for a live system.</p> <h3 id="unit-vs-integration-testing" data-v-b8113688><span id="unit-vs-integration-testing" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Unit vs Integration testing<a href="#unit-vs-integration-testing" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>Unit testing is testing individual components, in isolation. For components with dependancies, these dependancies are mocked to ensure that any errors
would be due to bugs in the component itself, and not its underlying dependancies. An example of this in TEAMMATES would be that when doing unit testing
for the logic layer, which depends on the database layer, we mock the database layer.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Integration testing on the other hand, tests if the various components are working when combined together. Building upon the unit testing example, when doing
integration testing for the logic layer, we would not mock the database layer, but rather have the database layer actually perform its operations.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Having both of these types of tests are necessary in a big system like TEAMMATES: unit testing gives us the reassurance that the invididual components
are working on its own, while integration testing ensures that they work together. With good unit testing, we can be certain that any issues in integration
testing is most likely due to the interaction between the components, rather than the component itself, making debugging easier. The tests together ensures that no
breaking changes are introduced to the system, and is thus essential in a live system like TEAMMATES.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/the-difference-between-unit-integration-and-functional-testing/" data-v-b8113688>Here</a> is an article that summarises the differences between

The lifecycle starts when Angular instantiates the component class and reders the component view. There are multiple lifecycle hook methods that can be used in our application to respond to lifecycle events. For example, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>ngDoCheck</code> allows developers the customise change-detection, meaning when there is a change to the component, this method will detect the changes and perform some operation specified by the developers.</li> <li data-v-b8113688>In Angular applications, we can pass data between parent and child components using <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>@Input()</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>@Output()</code> decorators. More specifically, in the child component, we can decorate the property with <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>@Input()</code> and in the parent component template, we can use property binding to bind the property of the child component to the property of the parent component using the square bracket, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>[]</code>. In this way, data can be passed from the parent to the child. Conversly, to send the data from the child to the parent, we can use the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>@Output()</code> decorator and an <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>EventEmitter</code>.

However, after performing some updates despite first flushing the updates and then fetching them during testing, the joined entities were not found. This led to failing test cases.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Upon consultation with my mentors Hieu and Samuel, I realised that this was caused due to only updating relations from 1 side in the Entities which is intentionally set currently (due to circular bidirectional dependencies causing cascade errors).
This caused the persistence context to not be updated despite the database being correctly updated.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Hence, I learnt and implemented <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>HibernateUtil.getSession.clear()</code> to allow for the managed entity cache to be cleared and hence ensure that the entities are fetched from the updated database.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>By using flush then clear, this ensures that the entities read transaction caused by clear is after the write transaction caused by flush, hence this results in a view serializable transaction schedule which fixes the test cases.</p> <h4 id="hibernate-flushing-behavior" data-v-b8113688><span id="hibernate-flushing-behavior" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Hibernate flushing behavior<a href="#hibernate-flushing-behavior" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>Also, I learnt that flushing does not cause the transaction to commit and only orders the SQL statements to be queued for execution.
However, it is not a good practice to force a commit for each transaction as it would negatively affect the performance and hence Hibernate's rationale for not mandating a commit after each flush (commits only occur after a certain number of transactions). <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12688827/hibernate-not-updating-database-after-flush" data-v-b8113688>Stackoverflow post</a>.</p> <h4 id="eager-and-lazy-loading-concept" data-v-b8113688><span id="eager-and-lazy-loading-concept" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Eager and Lazy loading concept<a href="#eager-and-lazy-loading-concept" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>I've also learnt that in Hibernate, eager loading means that related entities are loaded from the database along with the main entity, while lazy loading means that related entities are only loaded when they are explicitly accessed.

able to tab to elements that are hidden or not visible at the moment. For headers, headings should be used to help
users quick navigate between sections, and should be used in order without skipping numbers, so as to avoid
confusion.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>Aria attributes:</strong> There are many aria attributes, but the ones mainly used are <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>aria-label</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>aria-role</code>, and
<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>aria-hidden</code>. <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>aria-label</code> labels an element so that the screen reader knows what to read when the user is focusing
on that element. In the same vein, it is important to attach (descriptive) labels to fields for the same reason.
<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>aria-role</code> is used to tell the screen reader what role an element plays in the webpage, so that it knows what to
tell the user. Finally, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>aria-hidden</code>, when set to <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>true</code>, tells the screen reader to skip past this element. This
might be desirable because sometimes we don't want images or small icons to be captured by the screen reader.</p> <h4 id="mobile-friendliness" data-v-b8113688><span id="mobile-friendliness" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Mobile Friendliness<a href="#mobile-friendliness" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>I learnt about mobile friendliness and how to design a webpage in a way that is able to fit and work well in
various screen widths. One way to do so, and in fact the way we mostly use, is by using Bootstrap's breakpoints,
which helps to set styles depending on the screen width of the device.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>Certain elements need to be redesigned to fit smaller screenwidths. The elements that I learnt about, and read about
different design considerations, are modals and tables. In particular, there are several guidelines that specify
how each should be laid out.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>When thinking about how the frontend should look like, it is important to treat it from a user's perspective.
Certain issues might not come to mind if we think of it purely as a developer, e.g. buttons need to be spaced
further apart on mobile as putting them closer together makes it more difficult to press using fingers (as opposed
to when using a mouse).</p> <h3 id="backend-4" data-v-b8113688><span id="backend-4" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Backend<a href="#backend-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <p data-v-b8113688>I learnt about how to properly migrate data across different databases while ensuring that the system stays up and
operational. It felt that this way of managing the dual databases required a lot of effort in implementing double
logic in each action, entity, etc, but since most of the extra code would be retained, I found this to be a good
approach.</p> <h4 id="hibernate-orm-2" data-v-b8113688><span id="hibernate-orm-2" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Hibernate ORM<a href="#hibernate-orm-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>I didn't learn about Hibernate ORM in much detail as I was mainly involved in user-friendliness. What I learnt from
the mentors was that Hibernate helps to map entity classes to database records (along with annotations that provide
useful information about the fields, such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>@Nullable</code>), and also about entity states and session flushing.</p> <p data-v-b8113688>In addition, I learnt about Hibernate's methods for database operations, and how these methods can be used in place
of SQL queries for reasons like safety and performance.</p> <h4 id="docker-4" data-v-b8113688><span id="docker-4" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Docker<a href="#docker-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>Docker makes starting services easier, and enables placing applications into various containers. I briefly looked
into how Docker is used, in particular how the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>docker compose</code> command works and how configurations can be
specified inside the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-b8113688>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p> <h3 id="others" data-v-b8113688><span id="others" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Others<a href="#others" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h3> <h4 id="testing-5" data-v-b8113688><span id="testing-5" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Testing<a href="#testing-5" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>Unit testing:</strong> I learnt about unit testing, which is testing individual components in isolation, when looking
through the backend code for the onboarding task and later for the migration. I also learnt about how dependencies
should be mocked so as to properly test for bugs in the current class without interference from other classes.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>Integration testing:</strong> I wrote a few integration tests for the migration, which tested if the various classes
were working together as intended. This usually involved ensuring data or errors are properly transferred across
the backend layers (e.g. database, actions, etc).</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>Snapshot testing:</strong> These were the tests that I worked with the most, and are mostly frontend focused. I found
that they were most useful in helping me determine whether a change in code resulted in a similar change in the
webpage. This meant that looking through the potential changes in snapshot tests were crucial in ensuring that
these changes were to be expected.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>E2E testing:</strong> E2E tests help to test the application from end to end, as the name suggests. This involves opening
the browser, navigating to the page, interacting with elements, verifying state of webpage and database, etc. The
scale of the test means that it takes a long time to run. I also learnt about the instability of the tests, and why
it usually had to be run multiple times in order to pass. A skill I learnt was to analyse the error and determine
from there whether the test was failing because of code changes or because of instability.</p> <p data-v-b8113688><strong data-v-b8113688>Importance of testing:</strong> While the importance of testing is always quite intuitively understood, I think that
seeing it in action makes its importance more pronounced. This is especially the case for regression testing like
in the migration, where we want to ensure that adding in the second database doesn't change or break the Datastore
(as we want both to function simultaneously).</p> <h4 id="git-3" data-v-b8113688><span id="git-3" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>Git<a href="#git-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>I learnt several useful commands by searching online for solutions to pain points or just from talking to the rest
of the team. For instance, I learnt about fetching a PR's code directly from the PR, which helped in reviews.</p> <h4 id="oss" data-v-b8113688><span id="oss" class="anchor" data-v-b8113688></span>OSS<a href="#oss" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-b8113688></a></h4> <p data-v-b8113688>I learnt how to better give code reviews, and in particularly how to think about it in a way that made code
consistent across the entire application (e.g. the &quot;space before checkbox&quot; issues). I also learnt the importance of
presenting feedback across in a clear and conducive way.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <i id="scroll-top-button" onclick="handleScrollTop()" aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-arrow-circle-up
