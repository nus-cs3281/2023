### Project 1: [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/content)

> MDN Web Docs is an open-source, collaborative project that documents web technologies including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Web APIs. Alongside detailed reference documentation, we provide extensive learning resources for students and beginners getting started with web development.

### My Contributions

As MDN Web Docs is an educational resource, my main contribution focus has been on
- researching and replying to issues to help developers with their problems
- improving the clarity of existing documentation by linking, cross-refencing official specification, adding examples, and rewriting confusing sections
- fixing documentation bugs (e.g. typos, broken links, incorrect outputs in interactive examples)

#### Small-scale
As part of getting familiar with the MDN Web Docs workflow, I have made several (10+) PRs fixing small-scale issues. Most of such work has been done at the start of my contribution period, and I have since kept them to a minimum on a weekly basis, to explore more complex issues.

Selected PRs:
- [Add warning for CSS image-orientation's limitation on cross-origin images #23513](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/23513)
- [Add details about the behavior of Selection.setBaseAndExtent() on text nodes #23509](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/23509)

#### Medium-to-large scale

This includes PRs that are more complex and require more research and effort to complete.

Selected PRs:
- [move Web/API/Element/openOrClosedShadowRoot by tlylt · Pull Request #23989 · mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/23989)

### My Learning Record

#### Reflection
Tools/technologies I learned:
- All things web related (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, HTTP, etc.)

Resources:
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - It itself is a great web development resource!
- [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
  - The official specification for HTML

#### Project Workflow
It's quite easy to start contributing to the project, as it can be done entirely on GitHub. With the use of Markdown, it is also easy to make simple changes to the documentation. The general workflow goes as follows:
- Editing files and tracking changes in git
- Creating a pull request
- Check the preview of the changes
- Get the PR reviewed and merged by one of the owners

#### Lessons Learned


#### What can be adopted by MarkBind

- Automatic PR flaw detection (e.g. broken links, typos, etc.)
- Establishing code owners and auto-assigning reviewers
- A dedicated documentation dashboard for writing documentation

#### Suggested areas of improvement for the external project

I think the project has merit in its own right, especially given the number of page views it gets. However, I think there are indeed areas of improvement that can be made.
For example, the search functionality and UX is not as good as it could be. While the search input box gives immediate results in the form of a dropdown, if the search term is
not found, the user will have to go to the dedicated search page, which shows a list of search results in plain text. This feels awkward, and I think I would be forced to search
for the same term on Google instead. Another thing for improvement is the sidebar. The left sidebar of pages can be quite long and at times, it is not clear how the pages are structured.
I think better categorization of the items in the sidebar would help.
