### Project 1: [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/content)

> MDN Web Docs is an open-source, collaborative project that documents web technologies including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Web APIs. Alongside detailed reference documentation, we provide extensive learning resources for students and beginners getting started with web development.

### My Contributions

As MDN Web Docs is an educational resource, my main contribution focus has been on
- researching and replying to issues to help developers with their problems
- improving the clarity of existing documentation by linking, cross-refencing official specification, adding examples, and rewriting confusing sections
- fixing documentation bugs (e.g. typos, broken links, incorrect outputs in interactive examples)

#### Small-scale
As part of getting familiar with the MDN Web Docs workflow, I have made several (10+) PRs fixing small-scale issues. Most of such work has been done at the start of my contribution period, and I have since kept them to a minimum on a weekly basis, to explore more complex issues.

Selected PRs:
- [Add warning for CSS image-orientation's limitation on cross-origin images #23513](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/23513)
- [Add details about the behavior of Selection.setBaseAndExtent() on text nodes #23509](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/23509)

#### Medium-to-large scale

TBD

### My Learning Record

#### Reflection
Tools/technologies I learned:
- All things web related (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, HTTP, etc.)

Resources:
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - It itself is a great web development resource!
- [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
  - The official specification for HTML

#### Project Workflow
It's quite easy to start contributing to the project, as it can be done entirely on GitHub. With the use of Markdown, it is also easy to make simple changes to the documentation. The general workflow goes as follows:
- Editing files and tracking changes in git
- Creating a pull request
- Check the preview of the changes
- Get the PR reviewed and merged by one of the owners
